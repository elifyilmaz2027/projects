# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects  
In this repository, there are several machine learning and deep learning projects. The tasks and data are given by instructors from Boğaziçi University in classes CMPE462, CMPE544, CMPE597, EC48Y, MATH585 and MATH541. Also, some projects were done in programs (inzva) followed  as online. Beriefly, the project topics are:  
-Logistic Regression from scratch for classification of handwritten digit 1 and digit 5  
-SVM for given data by using libsvm library  
-Sale price prediction for cars with Linear Regression  
-Classification of Turkish Lira Banknotes   
-PCA from scratch and k-means from scratch  
-Multiclass classification by using different models   
-Prediciton of Term-deposit by using different models  
-Expectation Maximization Algorithm from scratch for Gaussian Mixtures  
-Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent from scratch  
-Text generation with textgenrnn library  
-Fraud detection with Xgboost and Catboost  
-Random Variable Generation  
-Neural Language Model with Multi-layer Perceptron  
-Convolutional Neural Network Model for CIFAR10  
-Variational Autoencoder for MNIST  
The repository also includes some presentations in university classes or online courses.
