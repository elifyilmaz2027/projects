# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects  
In this repository, there are several machine learning and deep learning projects. The tasks and data are given by instructors from Boğaziçi University in classes __CSE551, CMPE462, CMPE544, CMPE597, EC48Y, MATH585 and MATH541.__ Also, some projects were done in programs (inzva) followed  as online. Beriefly, the project topics are:
- [Neural Language Model with Multi-layer Perceptron](https://github.com/elifyilmaz2027/projects/tree/main/Neural%20Language%20Model)  
- [Convolutional Neural Network Model for CIFAR10](https://github.com/elifyilmaz2027/projects/tree/main/Convolutional%20Neural%20Network)

- [Fraud detection with Xgboost and Catboost](https://github.com/elifyilmaz2027/projects/blob/main/Fraud%20detection.ipynb)  

Also, there are some problem solutions for random variable generation, polynomial regression algorithm, least squares, Taylor series, differential equations and Runge-Kutta methods.

The repository also includes presentations and proposals in university classes mentioned above. Some presentations talk about improvements for the paper and some presentations tell us about chapters from the books such as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop.    
- [MATH585 Presentations](https://github.com/elifyilmaz2027/projects/tree/main/Presentations-Math585)  
- [Random Variable Generation](https://github.com/elifyilmaz2027/projects/blob/main/Random%20Variable%20Generation/rvg_presentation.pdf)  
- [Improvements to Hierarchical LSTMs with Adaptive Attention for Visual Captioning](https://github.com/elifyilmaz2027/projects/tree/main/hLSTM%20for%20visual%20captioning)  
- [Presentations about Christopher M. Bishop PR and ML](https://github.com/elifyilmaz2027/projects/tree/main/presentations%20-%20Christopher%20M.%20Bishop%20PR%20and%20ML)
