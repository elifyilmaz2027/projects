# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects  
In this repository, there are several machine learning and deep learning projects. The tasks and data are given by instructors from Boğaziçi University in classes __CSE551, CMPE462, CMPE544, CMPE597, EC48Y, MATH585 and MATH541.__ Also, some projects were done in programs (inzva) followed  as online. Beriefly, the project topics are:
